# Advent of Code 2021
Experiment in learning Go
 
To run, open a terminal in the root folder of the project and run with
1. `go run . <day to run> <optional relative input path>`
2. `go build .` followed by `.\ aoc_2021.exe <day to run> <optional relative input path>`

You can run this code with your own input file. the file path needs to be relative to the root of the project.

 DISCLAIMERS:
 1. This is my first attempt dabbling in Go. As such, please do not use it as an example of idiomatic go. It is not. Feedback would be most welcome.
 2. I omitted error handling, since it is not so relevant for the scope of this project
