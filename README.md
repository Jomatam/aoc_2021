# aoc_2021
 Advent of Code 2021, experiment in learning Go
 
 To run, open a terminal in the root folder of the project and run with
 1. `go run . <day to run>`
 2. `go build .` followed by `.\ aoc_2021.exe <day to run>`
 
 DISCLAIMER:
 This is my first attempt dabbling in Go. As such, please do not use it as an example of idiomatic go. It is not. Feedback would be most welcome.
