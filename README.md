# aoc_2021
Advent of Code 2021, experiment in learning Go
 
To run, open a terminal in the root folder of the project and run with
1. `go run . <day to run> <optional relative input path>`
2. `go build .` followed by `.\ aoc_2021.exe <day to run> <optional relative input path>`

You can run this code with your own input file. the file path needs to be relative to the root of the project.

The project contains unit tests based on my input files. This allows you to make changes to the files and validate functional correctness.
 
 DISCLAIMERS:
 1. This is my first attempt dabbling in Go. As such, please do not use it as an example of idiomatic go. It is not. Feedback would be most welcome.
 2. I omitted error handling, since it is not so relevant for the scope of this project
